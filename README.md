# Taxpayer Enlistment Project

This project is a web application developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. The main objective of this application is to allow the registration of taxpayers in a database.

# Main features

Registration of taxpayers with their personal information such as name, surname, telephone number, etc.
Allocation of a unique registration number to each registered taxpayer.
Friendly user interface with interactive forms and confirmation dialogs.
Integration with Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
Using Tailwind CSS to style the user interface and ensure a modern and responsive user experience.

# What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of React and explore advanced concepts such as hooks, routes, and form management. I also learned how to integrate Firebase into a React application for user authentication and real-time data storage.

# Problems encountered

One of the challenges I faced was managing application state and syncing data with Firebase. However, thanks to the detailed documentation of React and Firebase, I was able to overcome these obstacles and create a functional and performant application.
